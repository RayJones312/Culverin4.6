Culverin4.6
===========

Project Culverin, an upcoming FPS.

In order to play the game or view the project, you'll need to get the GitHub desktop application. Install it, run it,
and press the "Clone in Desktop" button over to your right. Now, if you don't want to bother with all that, you COULD just press 
the "download to zip" button, which will just download a zipped copy of everything you see here. But if you do that, it will make 
getting updates to the game a nightmare (you'll have to redownload the whole game every time). So get the Github app.

Now, when you start the game, it won't give you a menu. It will throw you right into the game. You're in a friendly zone though.
Don't shoot the people there. Don't do it. The box to the right of the room will let you change your equipment. If you walk up to the guy
behind the table he'll give you something to do. The guy to the left can be hired to fight along side you, but only if you have
enough money to hire him.

You'll probably notice that the equipment selection screen has two sections: weapons and modules. You are allowed two weapons and four
modules. Modules are like boosts - they give you special abilities and are interchangeable. Some increase your movement speed, some let
you jump higher, etc. Some give you actual new mechanics to work with, but you won't see many of those in the demo.

Once you start a mission, understand one thing: DON'T LET THOSE BLUE MANNEQUINS DIE. They aren't mannequins. They're innocent civilians.
You'll get a pretty nasty penalty to the payout of that mission for each one of them that gets killed. The rule of thumb is: if enemies see you,
they shoot at you. Don't situate yourself such that there's a civilian in direct line of fire between you and the enemy. They'll die. Pretty much
guaranteed.

Anyway, have fun! Don't get killed!
